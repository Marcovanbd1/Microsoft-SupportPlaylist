        <h1>What if help was just a conversation away</h1>
        <p>
          Right now, millions of people are struggling.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not with technology.<br>
          With life.
        </p>
        <p class="quote">
          "I cannot sleep. I feel anxious all the time."<br>
          "I lost my job. I do not know how to pay rent."<br>
          "Mum is getting worse. I need help caring for her."
        </p>
        <p>
          They search Google. They scroll endlessly. They ask conversational AI.<br>
          They give up. They wait until crisis.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="highlight">What if they could just speak</span>, and Microsoft understood.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not a search query.<br>
          A real conversation.<br>
          A human moment.
        </p>
        <p>
          And what came back was not a list of links.<br>
          But a <span class="highlight">Support Playlist</span>.<br>
          A clear, personal path to help.

        <h2>Meet Sarah. Thirty four. Awake at 11pm.</h2>
        <p>
          She opens her laptop.<br>
          Windows 12 is running.
        </p>
        <p>
          She does not open a browser.<br>
          She does not type keywords.

          Microsoft listens.<br>
          The AI understands enough.<br>
          Not everything. Just enough.

        <p>
          Three seconds later, a <span class="highlight">Support Playlist</span> appears.

          A clear, sequenced path forward.

        <p>
          Sarah did not need to know where to look.<br>
          She did not need to understand the system.<br>
          She just said what was happening.
